## Description
Music Matchbox is a social networking platform where musicians can find fellow musicians to form bands with. Upon signing up for the site, you provide contact information along with your story and the instruments that you play. Once logged in, you can add information for your band (if you have one) including the instruments that you are looking to add to your group. This is one-stop shopping for those in bands that are looking for new members as well as solo players who are looking to join a group.
